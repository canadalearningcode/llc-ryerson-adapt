      #Schedule

      <strong> Important note:</strong>
      This is a guideline, not a rule! It is more important that the learners are following along then it is to get to the end of the slides!

      <em>Please note</em>: this schedule is for a single day workshop.
      If you are leading two weekday evenings, you can split this schedule up accordingly. Please remember to take a 15-30 minute break on both days. The first 15-20 minutes of the second day should be allocated for review and questions from the prior session.

      * <strong>Getting Started (10:00 am - 11:00 am)</strong>: Mentor intros, Development Environment, Technology Overview, mini exercise
      * <strong>Intro to Functions and Variables (11:00 am - 12:30 pm)</strong>: Functions, first class exercise, intro to variables, second class exercise
      * <strong>Lunch Break! (12:30 pm - 1:30 pm)</strong>
      * <strong>Today's Project (1:30 pm -2:00 pm)</strong>: Overview of project, declaring and assigning variables, arithmetic operators, concatenation
      * <strong>Custom Objects and functions (2:00 pm - 2:30 pm)</strong>: Object properties, methods, the DOM, custom functions,
      * <strong>Conditionals (2:30 pm - 3:30 pm)</strong>: Quantities exercises, conditionals
      * <strong>Wrapping up (3:30 pm - 4:00 pm)</strong>: Comparison and logical operators, bonus exercise (optional), next steps & resources


      <br>
      #General Notes

      * <strong>Important!</strong> Please give learners enough time to download learner files from slide 1 - check in as people are entering the room to make sure they have learner files, Atom & Chrome ready so you can start the experience on time.
      Encourage them to ask yourself or a mentor for help with installation!
      * A common issue with leaner files - make sure Windows users extract the folder. If a learner sees the slides without any styles, that is probably why.
      * Show learners how to open files. Go through the steps - e.g. Open Atom > File > add project folder. Do it slowly or show them twice if necessary.
      * Show learners how to copy text from slides + paste into atom. Keyboard shortcuts can be new to some learners: Remember to mention them especially since they're invisible to them when you use keyboard shortcuts on the overhead projector. PLEASE mention both Windows & Mac shortcuts, not just 1 or the other!
      * Remind learners to constantly SAVE + REFRESH (and show them how). Encourage them to make small changes at a time, save, and refresh. Show them how to Undo from shortcuts or the edit menu.
      * Share shortcuts and tips on navigating between windows. Hot corners, shortcut keys, taskbar hovers. Whatever works.

      #Specific Examples

      <h2>Notes</h2>

      <strong>Slide 4: Today's project</strong>
        Take some time to walk through the example site. It can help learners visualize what they are working towards.

      <strong>Slide 12: HTML Syntax</strong>
        These keys are fairly foreign to beginners, so it doesn't hurt to take some time to point them out and gain familiarity.

      <strong>Slide 14: HTML Syntax</strong>
        "Node" is a new word we are adding to the learner's vocabulary. Explain what it means.

      <strong>Slide 22: The Head Element</strong>
        An analogy you can use: people can see your body, but they cannot see what is going on inside your head. Obviously, what is going on inside your head is integral for your body to function, but that data is essentially hidden from view.

      <strong>Slide 24: Attributes</strong>
        Content written between tags will be seen by the user in the browser. Like the contents of the head, attributes are doing important work behind the scenes, but they are hidden from view. They are kind of like the crew of a film. You never see them directly in the scene (in our case, the viewport of the browser), but they have a huge influence on the end result.

      <strong>Slide 25:</strong>
        If your learners are creating a web page in Mandarin, Greek, Russian, Arabic, etc. they will need to work with an entirely different character set. If they are working on a bilingual site in English & French, this same character set is used on both.

      <strong>Slide 52: CSS colours</strong>
        Using words to describe colours made more sense in the past, when our monitors were only able to show a small finite number of colours. Now that our monitor technology has improved, there would be no way to come up with a name for every possible colour we could use.

      <strong>Slide 53: CSS colours</strong>
        **colorpicker.com** will allow you to choose 1 colour at a time, and grab the hex code. The other resources here can help to choose a colour scheme.

      <strong>Slide 54: CSS Font Styles</strong>
        Note the American spelling of the word colour!

      <strong>Slide 55: Web safe fonts</strong>
        Take some time to explain the difference between a serif, sans-serif, and monospace font. Display and Cursive are two other categories that can be used for headlines, but are not suitable for the majority of content.

      <strong>Slide 57:</strong>
        I usually copy the CSS Google Fonts provides, for however many fonts you have selected, and add them as a comment at the top of my stylesheet. That way we can save them in one place and copy and paste it wherever I need it later.

      <strong>Slide 66: Class Exercise: Background Colours</strong>
        You can use a comment beside a hex code to describe the colour so you understand what that line of code means

      <strong>Slide 71: Practice!</strong>
        I like to describe padding/margin using the example of shipping a product, particuarly something fragile, like a piece of jewellery. If the element itself it the necklace, the padding is the bubble wrap, tissue paper or packing peanuts that goes inside the box to insulate the product. The border is the outer edge of the box itself, and the margin is the space outside of the box (or how far away one box is from another box).

      <strong>Slide 74: Class Exercise: Spacing</strong>
        Ask the learners to answer this question

      <strong>Slide 76: Descendant selectors</strong>
        Note the comment in the last example reads the descendant selector from right to left. This can be a better way for some learners to visualize it.

      <strong>Slide 82:</strong>
        Note that only an image that is a perfect square will look like a circle when border radius is applied. Otherwise it will look like an oval.

      <strong>Slide 110: Where to find API documentation</strong>
        Underscore the importance of referencing and reading Documentation as a web developer.
